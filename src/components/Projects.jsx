              I've tackled a variety of exciting projects that showcase my full
              stack prowess. From designing a comprehensive Restaurant
              Management System that streamlines food ordering and delivery, to
              developing an Image to Icon Converter thatâ€™s become very useful
              among my friends in College days, I love turning ideas into
              functional, efficient solutions.Each project has honed my skills
              and contributed to significant performance improvements, making me
              a versatile and resourceful developer ready to take on any
              challenge.
